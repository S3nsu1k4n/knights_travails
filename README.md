# Knights Travails

The Odin Project: Knights Travails

# Introduction

In this project, I am implementing Knights Travails using ruby.

On a 8x8 chess board all steps a knight has to move to go from his initial position to any other square on the chess board, should be found recursively and each step has to be printed.
Example:
knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3])

=> 3 moves

[3, 3]

[4, 5]

[2, 4]

[4, 3]
